        This Refund and Cancellation Policy applies to all purchases made on Traffic Tips
        (the "Platform"), operated from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Nature of our services</h2>
      <p>
        Traffic Tips provides digital educational content, mock tests, practice quizzes and
        AI-assisted study tools for Kerala RTO Learner Licence preparation. All products
        and services offered on the Platform are digital in nature and are delivered

      </p>

      <h2>2. No refunds</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>All purchases made on Traffic Tips are final and strictly non-refundable.</strong>
        Since our products are digital goods that are consumed immediately after purchase,
        we do not offer refunds, exchanges, or returns for any reason, including but not
        limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change of mind after purchase</li>
        <li>Failure to clear the RTO learner licence test</li>
        <li>Non-usage of the purchased content or mock tests</li>
        <li>Lack of familiarity with digital products</li>
        <li>Accidental or duplicate purchases (please review your order carefully before paying)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Cancellations</h2>
      <p>
        As access to digital content is granted immediately upon successful payment,
        orders cannot be cancelled once payment is confirmed.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Payment failures & duplicate charges</h2>
      <p>
        If your payment is debited from your bank account but you do not receive access
        to the purchased content, or if you are charged twice for the same order due to a
        technical error, please contact us within 7 days of the transaction with your
        payment reference. Verified duplicate or failed transactions will be reversed to
        the original payment method within 7–14 business days.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Service disruptions</h2>
      <p>
        Occasional downtime for maintenance or unforeseen technical issues does not
        qualify for a refund. We will make reasonable efforts to restore service as
        quickly as possible.
